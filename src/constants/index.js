Teachers can create secure accounts, manage classes, and assign shorthand-based tasks with reference text and optional handwritten shorthand image uploads. Students log in with credentials, view assignments, and type based on visual shorthand cues. The system performs automated evaluation using lookahead and character-level comparison logic, highlighting errors and tracking typing speed, accuracy, and time taken. Data is securely stored and visualized for both students and teachers through Firebase. The decentralized architecture allows independent class management without any centralized admin panel, offering scalability for multiple educators.",

Files are transferred in base64-encoded encrypted chunks using AES-256-CBC with RSA-2048 key exchange for maximum security. It includes a 3-way TCP handshake for metadata exchange, followed by UDP-based file transfer with unique sockets per file ID. A built-in failure handling mechanism ensures retry logic with a limit of 3 attempts per chunk. Transfers can resume from the last successfully received chunk, thanks to SQLite-based session tracking. Additionally, dynamic chunk sizing adapts to network conditions, optimizing speed while reducing CPU load. DropShare also supports simultaneous multi-device connections using LAN or hotspot mode.",
